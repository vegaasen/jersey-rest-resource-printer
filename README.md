# What iz diz?

During the recent years I've been fiddeling a lot with the Sun Jersey libraries and written quite a lot of services using this awsome library. However, I often get a question similar to this:

Hey! What services does this API provide?

..And then, each time - I have to give it a thought and produce the same answer each time:

"Uh, I dunno!:P"

Which results in me digging in to my own code to find all the restified methods within the application.

(and then you might argue: Hah! You should've done some better documentation you boon!! Well, I know:)...stfu!:P)

# How does it work?

Easy! If you have a Jersey-enabled application - just add the jarfile to your classpath and you'll be set to go!

# What does it produce?

It produces a map of all links, resources, verbs etc in the provided packagepath. Easy as that.
